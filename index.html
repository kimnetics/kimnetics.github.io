      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      I can help you chart a path to the future for your software systems. I can help you find solutions to your complex
      software problems. I have had the opportunity to guide and participate in the creation of many successful systems.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      What I bring is breadth and depth of experience combined with highly creative thinking that will provide you
      with complete solutions that live well over time. I have worked across departments at companies. I have worked
      with all levels of companies. I endeavor to ensure that my systems delight everyone involved.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I have done several long-lived systems. I know what it takes to make this possible. One of my systems, over a
      ten-year period, helped a company grow from being a startup with thirteen thousand customers to become a
      billion-dollar NASDAQ company with thirteen million customers. My system was their customer database, product
      database, billing system and CRM system.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I have run my own companies which has honed my thinking on producing practical solutions that meet both customer
      and company needs.

        <h3>Accumulus (New System and Company)</h3>
        <p>I co-founded Accumulus which sells a Microsoft Azure based subscription billing and management system. I
          was the primary architect of the system and a major code contributor. The system provides a browser based user
          interface. I also designed iOS and Windows Phone credit card applications. The system has been available since
          Azure launched.</p>

        <h3>Inovaware (New System and Company)</h3>
        <p>I co-founded Inovaware which sells PRISM, a server room architecture subscription billing and management
          system. I was the co-architect of the system and a major code contributor. PRISM installations may use the
          Oracle, SQL Server or Microsoft Access relational databases. PRISM has a Windows client application for its
          user interface.</p>

        <h3>GRADVISE (New System)</h3>
        <p>I created a graduation advisement system for Honolulu Community College. The system was later used by
          all the Hawaii community colleges. It was eventually acquired and sold by the vendor that provided the school
          administration software for the community colleges.
