      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer who can add a new perspective and energy to your team. I have decades of experience and
      have guided and nurtured many successful systems. I am an innovative thinker who regularly reflects on what is
      possible and how to improve things. I have worked on several patents. I view systems from many angles after having
      filled the roles of software engineer, software architect, product manager, consultant and company leader. I
      create software with a lot of precision and attention to detail. I aim to raise the expectations of what is
      possible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I believe in integrity, continuous growth, optimism and kindness.

        <p>I co-founded Accumulus which sells a Microsoft Azure based subscription billing and management system. I
          was the primary architect of the system and a major code contributor. The system provides a browser based user
          interface. I also designed iOS and Windows Phone credit card applications. The system has been available since
          Azure launched.</p>

        <h3>Inovaware (New System and Company)</h3>
        <p>I co-founded Inovaware which sells PRISM, a server room architecture subscription billing and management
          system. I was the co-architect of the system and a major code contributor. PRISM has a Windows client
          application for its user interface. Salesforce.com used the software. j2 Global used the software to go from
          startup to NASDAQ traded.</p>

        <p>I created a graduation advisement system for Honolulu Community College. The system was later used by
          all the Hawaii community colleges. It was eventually acquired and sold by the vendor that provided the school
          administration software for the community colleges.
